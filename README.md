This project predicts customer churn using scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, KNN, RandomForestClassifier) and TensorFlow neural networks. It aims to compare traditional and deep learning models for churn prediction.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* TensorFlow
* TensorFlow Hub

### Instructions
* Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/iamharshvardhan/Customer-Churning-Prediction.git
```
* Open the `churn-prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
* Run the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the deep-learning model.

### Results
- We compared sklearn's LogisticRegression, KNearestNeighbour and RandomForestClassifier and tune their hyperparameters to find the most accurate model possible.
- The deep learning model we have used is (`Sequential`) with 3 layers of neural networks.
